EMMS Lab Experiment
Earth Movement Monitoring System (EMMS) 
Laboratory Experiment in September 2019 
conducted by Jon Barnes

This system monitors Earth Movement (Landslides) at seperate Sensor Nodes and relays the information back to the Base Unit via 2.4ghz radio (utilizing data packets checked with CRN over a tree network). This project uses; Arduino Unos, Accelerometers and Gyroscopes (MPU 6050 on GY-521), nrf24L01+ radios, and micro sd card.
